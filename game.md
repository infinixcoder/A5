Rivers and Stones: Game Rules

# 1. Objective

The primary goal is to be the first player to place the required number of your Stone pieces (face-up) into your designated scoring area (SA).

You can also win if your opponent runs out of their total allotted time before the game's objective is met.

# 2. Game Setup

## The Board

The game is played on one of three board configurations:

Small (13x12): 12 pieces per player. The scoring area (SA) requires 4 stones to win.

Medium (15x14): 14 pieces per player. The scoring area (SA) requires 5 stones to win.

Large (17x16): 16 pieces per player. The scoring area (SA) requires 6 stones to win.

## The Pieces

Each player has an identical set of pieces. Each piece is two-sided:

Stone Side: A solid-colored piece. This is the only side that can be used for scoring.

River Side: A piece with a line (horizontal or vertical) indicating a "flow direction." This side is used for rapid, long-distance movement.

# 3. Game Ending

A game ends in one of the following ways:

Victory: A player fills their scoring area with the required number of stones (4, 5, or 6).

Win on Time: An opponent's timer runs out.

Draw: Both players run out of time, or the maximum number of moves (500) is reached.

# 4. Player Actions

On your turn, you must choose one of the following four actions:

## 1. Move a Piece (Stone or River)

You can move one of your pieces (either a Stone or a River).

### General Movement:

Move exactly one step (up, down, left, or right) to an adjacent, empty intersection.

### General Restrictions:

Pieces must always be on the grid intersections.

You cannot move into or pass through your opponent's scoring area.

You cannot move off the board.

You cannot stack pieces.

### Special: River Movement:

If your piece (Stone or River) moves one step onto an intersection occupied by any River (yours or your opponent's), it may immediately travel any number of spaces along that River's flow direction (horizontal or vertical).

Travel stops if you hit another piece (yours or opponent's) or reach the end of the board.

If you land on another River, you may continue moving along its new flow direction.

River movement cannot be used to enter or cross the opponent's scoring area.

## 2. Push a Piece

You can use one of your pieces to push an adjacent piece. The rules for pushing differ based on which side of your piece you are using.

### Pushing with a Stone:

A Stone can push an adjacent piece (Stone or River) exactly one step in the same direction as the move.

This is only valid if the intersection behind the pushed piece is empty.

You cannot push a piece off the board, into the opponent's SA, or push a series of multiple pieces.

### Pushing with a River:

A River can push an adjacent Stone (yours or your opponent's).

The pushed Stone travels along the River's flow direction, following the rules of "River Movement" (see above). The active player chooses how far the piece is pushed.

The pushed piece cannot push other pieces along its path.

After the push, the River that initiated the action is flipped over to its Stone side.

## 3. Flip a Piece (and Rotate)

This action consumes your entire turn. You can flip one of your pieces at its current location.

Stone to River: The piece becomes a River. You must immediately choose its orientation (horizontal or vertical).

River to Stone: The piece becomes a Stone, which can now be used for scoring.

## 4. Rotate a River

This action consumes your entire turn.

You may choose one of your River pieces and rotate it 90 degrees (e.g., from horizontal to vertical or vice-versa).

You cannot choose to keep the same orientation or rotate it 180 degrees.
